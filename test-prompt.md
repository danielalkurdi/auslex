# Test Prompt for Australian Legal Citations

## User Prompt:
"Can you explain the key principles of Australian negligence law, including recent High Court decisions on causation and modern privacy legislation?"

## Expected AI Response with Citations:

In Australian tort law, the key elements of negligence are: 1) Duty of care, 2) Breach of duty, 3) Causation, and 4) Damage. The duty of care was established in Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562.

The High Court recently clarified the test for causation in negligence cases in NZYQ v Minister for Immigration [2023] HCA 37, which examined administrative detention powers. This was followed by ASF17 v Commonwealth [2024] HCA 19 regarding constitutional limits on detention.

For statutory frameworks, the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) s 13G requires APP entities to take reasonable steps to protect personal information. Additionally, the Online Safety Act 2021 (Cth) ss 30-35 provides mechanisms for content removal.

Recent Federal Court decisions like Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Google LLC [2021] FCA 367 have examined misleading conduct in digital contexts, while Palmer v Western Australia [2021] HCA 5 addressed emergency powers under the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth) s 477.

The Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) s 16 also establishes reporting requirements, and the Data Availability and Transparency Act 2022 (Cth) creates frameworks for government data sharing.
